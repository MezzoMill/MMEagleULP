h1. MMEagleULP - The EAGLE ULP that generates gcode for the MezzoMill.
    
The MMEagleULP is derived from pcb-gcode. Please see this site: http://www.pcbgcode.org

Why did I choose to create a copy of the pcb-gcode program?
1. I didn't want the user to be able to edit the settings for the MezzoMill and then be unable to get back into a usable state. 
2. I didn't want the user to use a different version of pcb-gcode (ex. via an upgrade) than I tested with and hit issues that I would be unable to solve.
3. I didn't want any changes I made to pcb-gcode usage to affect the normal  usage of pcb-gcode for other purposes. (ex The use of .mmg output instead of .tap)
